HTML, CSS, Git and Communication

## This assignment is to demonstrate a basic understanding of how to structure an HTML document and override presentation styles using CSS. You will also become familiar with GitHub for version control and Slack as a communication tool.

    Join the Slack Room using the link provided via CourseWeb, and direct message @w8s (Todd Waits) once you arrive.
        Preferred pronouns, preferred name, etc.
        Special accommodations in accordance with university policy
        your github username
    Create a GitHub repo following the classroom repo invite link provided in CourseWeb.
    Create an index.html file that introduces yourself, and apply CSS to override the default presentation of the HTML document in the browser.
        I want to see you define class and id attributes on HTML elements on your page.
        If you are using a base CSS framework like Bootstrap or Foundation, I would like you to override the style of at least your defined class, id, and a core HTML element.
        See the Live Coding Example (Source)
