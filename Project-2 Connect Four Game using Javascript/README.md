## Installation

1. Simply go to the directory and open in chrome web browser
2. Make sure all pictures are in the same folder as say28-connnect4.html

## Running the App

1. Type in player names and birthdays. Everything for this should work properly for the RegEx.
2. The game will determine the first player via birthdate(note that string representation of month will make game crash right now because I did not implement a way to convert string month to integer).
3. Once player order is determined hit begin game to start the clock and the game.
4. Once you get 4 in a row vertical or horizontally you win!.(note I did not implement checking for diagonal wins)
5. (I did not implment score or starting a new game).
